Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+


Code: 
Method 1: Using COUNT function and GROUP BY for a temporary table and selecting from there
SELECT Email 
FROM(SELECT Email, COUNT(Email) AS count
     FROM Person
     GROUP BY Email) AS Counts
WHERE Counts.count > 1

Method 2: Using GROUP BY with a HAVING clause.  More concise and efficient
SELECT Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(email) > 1;
