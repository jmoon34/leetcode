Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

Code:

Method 1: Getting Max of salary from a table without the highest salary
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)

Method 2: Using limit and offset to get the second.  We use the inside as a temporary table to select from to deal with tables with only one record.
SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT 
        Salary
    FROM
        Employee
    ORDER BY Salary DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;

Method 3: Using IFNULL(... , NULL) to return NULL
SELECT
    IFNULL(
        (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
         FROM Employee
         ORDER BY Salary DESC
         LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
        NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
;
